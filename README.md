Hi, I am Charley.

I am a QA professional based in Ireland with a strong interest in how testing, tooling, and product thinking intersect. I have worked across automation and manual testing, and I enjoy getting into the detail of how systems behave rather than just verifying that they work.

A lot of my background is in building and maintaining test automation using C# and Selenium WebDriver, with an emphasis on readability and long term maintainability. I have also worked with Playwright and Python, and I am comfortable moving between manual testing, functional and regression testing, unit level checks, database validation, and API testing depending on what the situation calls for.

More recently, my focus has shifted toward exploring how AI can be used responsibly within QA workflows. I use Model Context Protocol and rule driven approaches to integrate AI in a way that stays predictable and intentional. I am less interested in automation for its own sake, and more interested in reducing repetitive work while keeping human judgement firmly in the loop.

Alongside my QA work, I build small, focused micro SaaS products. One of these is SpecDrive, a tool that generates structured software test cases from written requirements. I built SpecDrive using Lovable to move quickly from idea to working product, Supabase for authentication and data storage, and Vercel for hosting and deployments. Building and running a real product has given me a much better appreciation of trade offs around cost, guardrails, usability, and long term maintainability.

I regularly work with Microsoft Azure DevOps to manage test cases, track defects, and maintain visibility across the development lifecycle. I am comfortable working independently or collaboratively, and I tend to gravitate toward roles where I can both question assumptions and improve how things are done.

Outside of day to day work, I enjoy learning and writing about QA and tooling, and sharing what I am experimenting with. I am particularly interested in practical approaches to quality that scale without becoming overly complex.
