# 👋 Hi, I'm Charley

### 💫 About Me:
I'm a QA professional based in Ireland with hands-on experience in both automation and manual testing. I have developed automation frameworks using C# and Selenium WebDriver, applying the Fluent Interface design pattern to ensure readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

I have worked across a variety of testing approaches including manual, functional, regression, unit, and database testing. I also bring experience with Playwright, Python, and the Cursor IDE.

I use Model Context Protocol (MCP) alongside testing to integrate AI into my workflow, enhancing test efficiency, decision-making, and structured communication throughout the QA process. My work is supported by tools like Microsoft Azure DevOps, where I manage test cases, track defects, and maintain visibility across the development lifecycle.

I'm confident working independently or collaboratively, with a strong analytical mindset that helps me address challenges effectively and drive continuous improvement.

I'm always open to learning, sharing, and advancing QA practices through innovation and technology.

⭐ Fun fact: I really enjoy gaming and going for runs.
