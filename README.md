I build tools and experiments at the intersection of QA, testing workflows, and practical AI.

Current focus:
- SpecDrive, a test case generator built with Lovable, Supabase, and Vercel
- Playwright automation using Python, focused on clarity and maintainability
- Rule driven and MCP based approaches to AI assisted testing
